The documents **WBDesign3.pdf** and **WBBOMDesign3.csv** were generated automatically using TI’s **WEBENCH Power Designer**: https://webench.ti.com/power-designer/

- **WBDesign3.pdf** — design report (topology, key equations/limits, efficiency and ripple estimates, Bode plot if available, recommended passives, and thermal notes).
- **WBBOMDesign3.csv** — BOM exported from WEBENCH for the selected design (MPNs, values, packages).
